    <!-- Task 1 -->
    <p>
    Python was invented in the late <em>1980s</em> <strong>by Guido van Rossum</strong> at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) <b><u><i>in <br>
    the Netherlands</i></u></b> as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling
     and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.

     <!-- Task 2 -->

    <!--1) b and strong tag -->
    <!--2) i and em tag -->

    <!-- 1)The difference between b and strong tag is that both visually darken the text, but strong tag makes it more readable than b tag -->
     <!--2) The difference between the i tag and the em tag is that both tags bend the text, visually there is no difference here either,
      but as I said before, the em tag makes it more difficult to read. -->
