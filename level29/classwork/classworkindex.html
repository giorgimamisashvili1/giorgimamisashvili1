    <!-- Task 1 -->

    <!--selectors -->

    <!-- There are many selectors in css, but they are used most often compared to others: hover, active, link and visited.
    For example the hover selector does styling for a specific html element, and the style is changed by moving the cursor. 
    The active selector also changes the style of a particular html element, but the element is styled by clicking on it. The 
    link sector, unlike other sectors, allows styling of links that
    have not yet been opened and are not used. The visited selector stylizes the link that has been used for some reason. -->


    <!-- property -->

    <!-- css property allows styling of html elements. There are many css properties, for example font-family, which changes the 
     style of the text, as well as font-color, font-weight, width, height, box-shadow, etc. -->


     <!-- Task 2 -->

     <!-- event -->

     <!-- programming parlance, an event is some action. For example, an event can be a mouse click or 
      pressing a key on the keyboard. An event can be a single element or even an HTML document -->
