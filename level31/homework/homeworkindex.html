    <!-- Task 3 -->

    <!-- We learned new css properties which are: list-style-type, list-style-image,
      border-radius, text-shadow, text-aligne, padding.
    list-style-type is a css property that changes the style of unordered and ordered 
    lists, as well as list-style-image, which replaces the pictures with your chosen photos. 
    The next css property is border-radius, this property simulates the corners of any html element, 
    and we only need to write four rules for border-radius, the next is text-shadow, this property simply 
    adds a shadow to any text, and this property also requires us to write only four rules, next The css property 
    is text-aligne, this relieves the fact that it changes the horizontal position of the text that occupies one whole 
    line of the site, such as p, the next css  property is padding, this property creates additional space, and because of 
    this, the border creates additional space beacouse padding area is the space between its content and its border -->

    

    <!-- Task 4 -->

    <!-- inline is an element that continues on one line, while block is an element that always starts on a new line -->



    <!-- Task 5 -->

    <!-- text-aligne doesn't work with buttons because text-aligne aligns block elements like headings and paragraphs and doesn't work for inline elements -->
