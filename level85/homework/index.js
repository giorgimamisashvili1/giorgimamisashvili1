    // why we use module.exports
    
    // module.exports is an old way to import one or more functions from one file into another file, 
    // or anything we want to transfer from the first file to the second.
    
    // why we use require() function
    
    // The require function provides communication between js files. So, without the require function, 
    // we cannot import (export) certain information from one file to another unless we specify the name of the file from 
    // which we want to extract certain information using the require function.
