    <!-- The order CSS property sets the order to lay out an item in a flex or grid container. Items in a container are sorted by ascending order value and then by their source code order. Items not given an explicit order value are assigned the default value of 0 . -->


    <!-- The align-self CSS property overrides a grid or flex item's align-items value. In grid, it aligns the item inside the grid area. In flexbox, it aligns the item on the cross axis -->
     <!-- auto: The item will use the value of align-items from the parent container. This is the default value if align-self is not specified.

    flex-start: Aligns the item at the start of the cross axis. For example, in a flex container with a row direction, this would align the item to the top of the container.

    flex-end: Aligns the item at the end of the cross axis. In a flex container with a row direction, this would align the item to the bottom of the container.

    center: Centers the item along the cross axis. In a flex container with a row direction, this would vertically center the item within the container.

    baseline: Aligns the item's baseline with the baseline of the parent container's cross axis. This is useful for text alignment in a flex container.

    stretch: Stretches the item to fill the container along the cross axis. This is the default value if align-items is set to stretch on the container. -->

    <!-- flex-start: Aligns the content to the start of the cross axis. This is the default value.

    flex-end: Aligns the content to the end of the cross axis.

    center: Centers the content along the cross axis.

    space-between: Distributes the content evenly along the cross axis, with the first item at the start and the last item at the end, leaving equal space between each item.

    space-around: Distributes the content evenly along the cross axis, with equal space around each item. This means the space before the first item and after the last item will be half the space between items.

    space-evenly: Distributes the content evenly along the cross axis, with equal space between each item, including before the first item and after the last item.

    stretch: Stretches the content to fill the available space along the cross axis. This is the default value in grid layout, but it may be ignored in flexbox when the items have fixed sizes. -->
