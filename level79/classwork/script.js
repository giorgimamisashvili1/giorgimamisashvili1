    // The rest operator is similar in writing style and is similar to the spread operator. But the rest operator, 
    // unlike the spread operator, is written as a parameter and there must be three dots after it, otherwise it will not work. 
    // When we use the rest operator as a function parameter, we are not limited by the number of arguments and we can write as many 
    // as we want, but if we do not write it as a list, it will not throw an error because there is only one parameter, but the rest 
    // operator perceives the 
    // arguments as a list and normally performs the actions that are written in the function.
    
    
        // spread operator
    
    // The spread operator is written in the same style as the rest operator. But the spread operator, 
    // unlike the rest operator, is written as an argument and also, as in the case of the rest operator, 
    // three dots are written behind it. In other cases, it will not work. For example, when we have a parameter 
    // given as a list and we write another element as an argument outside the list, the value of which is, for example, 
    // another list, it will not throw an error because the parameter is one and the argument is two. But if the variable that 
    // is newly added and no action is written on it in the function, if it has three dots written next to it, then this means that 
    // it is a spread operator and 
    // this list value will be added to the list on which the actions are written.
