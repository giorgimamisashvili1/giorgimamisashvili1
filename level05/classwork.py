#task1

#Rewriting the meaning is let's give an example let's take
num = 10
num = 20
num = 30
num = 40 #and so on
print(num)
#Here it will output the last thing that was written, i.e. the previous thing that was written was downloaded and print shows 40 also because
#show that print is written after num = 40, for example print if written after num = 10, it will display 10

#task2

#We use snake_case because it makes it easier to read. This lower dash is the same space, so it makes things easier.
discount_precent = 20
print(discount_precent)

#case-sensitive because a lot of attention is needed because upper and lower case letters can cause errors in most cases

#comments are mandatory because they make things easier for programmers and also for those people
#It has nothing to do with programming, because the comment explains what this written code does and what it affects.
